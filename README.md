## About Battle Snakes & How to play

I wanted to create a game that could be played by two people on the same keyboard. Using the arrow functions you can move the snake Up, Down, Left and Right. Try to collect as many items as you can but be careful not to hit the walls or yourself. 


## Challenges that came my way.

Styling the game came easy. Coding on the other hand wrecked my brain. The movemnt of the snake came easy and random functions to spawn the items came quick. The issues I had mainly revolved around the movement of the snakesbody and body functions

### Functions

## Peak at my Code

### Things I want to add in the future

My goal is to get the game at least working for one player. But in the future i plan on adding the following:

- Random items that have other effects like double growth or extra speed.
- Increase speed with each item eaten.
- Implement obstacles that are either fixed on the stage or moving so you can dodge.
- Ability to change the wallpaper in the home function.
- Better graphics for the snake or use images
